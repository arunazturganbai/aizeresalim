        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer
            grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge.
            Oppenheimer, upset with the demanding Blackett, leaves him a poisoned apple, but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr recommends that Oppenheimer should instead study theoretical physics at GÃ¶ttingen.
            He completes his PhD there and meets Isidor Isaac Rabi. The two later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California,
            Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology. He meets his future wife, Katherine "Kitty" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled Communist Party USA member who later commits suicide.</p>
